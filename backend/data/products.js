    description:
      "Cat's Best Original Cat Litter is the first cat litter that combines nature and high-tech developments. Technologically refined active wood fibres absorb moisture and odours, being stored deep inside. It is entirely natural and free from chemical additives. This allows Cat's Best Original Cat Litter to last longer, up to 7 weeks, in your cat's litter tray. This helps to reduce the amount of work you need to do to keep your cat's litter tray clean and full, as well as reducing costs. Cat's Best Original Cat Litter works best when you remove any solid waste and clumps regularly, disposing of them in the compost or your household toilet (although be sure to check with your local waste disposal before doing so).",
